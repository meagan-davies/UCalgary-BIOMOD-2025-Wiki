We did not complete all of the web lab experiments that we intended to finish, although we have completed some parts as listed below. Our main results came from modelling (see modelling section) regarding successful docking implementations involving our various target molecules and their respective DNA aptamers. We ended up choosing AÎ²42 over both of our p-tau molecules due it being a better and more consistent modelling peptide, unlike p-tau, which is more variable and disordered (an exist pdb file does not exist for tau as only certain portions of the protein can be modelled at a given time).   </p>

Our colorimetric assay produced interesting results, leading us to believe there was an error in the experimental process. The corrected absorbance values were not consistent with literature or our predicted results. This could be due to the time between prep of TMB stock and use. This step should be completed as close as possible to the actual experiment to ensure the TMB stock does not sit out, but it was left over a weekend before use. This may have led to exposure to light, and the TMB may have been partially oxidized. We also note that we did not have access to a multichannel pipette, which caused the timing to be varied and the wells, not plates, to be filled simultaneously.  </p>
